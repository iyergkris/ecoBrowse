# EcoBrowse Chrome Extension

This is a Next.js application built with Firebase Studio, designed to function as a Chrome extension. It analyzes the carbon footprint of visited websites and provides eco-friendly suggestions.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run Development Server (for Popup UI development):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This starts the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:9002`. You can open this URL in your browser to work on the UI components in isolation.

## Building the Extension

1.  **Build the Next.js App for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command runs `next build` followed by `next export`. The static files required for the Chrome extension will be placed in the `out` directory.

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
3.  Click on the **Load unpacked** button.
4.  Select the `out` directory generated by the build process.
5.  The EcoBrowse extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar. Click it to open the popup.

## Project Structure

-   `src/app/`: Contains the main Next.js application pages and layout (used for the extension popup).
-   `src/components/`: Reusable React components for the UI.
-   `src/services/`: Services like the mock carbon footprint calculator.
-   `src/ai/`: Genkit AI flows for generating suggestions.
-   `public/`: Static assets, including the `manifest.json` file, icons, and background/content scripts.
-   `out/`: (Generated after `npm run build`) Contains the static files for the Chrome extension.

## Core Features

-   **Footprint Calculation:** Estimates website carbon footprint based on mock data.
-   **Score Display:** Shows the score visually in the extension popup.
-   **Smart Suggestions:** Uses Genkit AI flows to provide tips and alternatives.
