# EcoBrowse

This is a Next.js application built with Firebase Studio. It analyzes the carbon footprint of visited websites and provides eco-friendly suggestions. It can function both as a standalone web application and as a Chrome extension popup UI.

## Getting Started (Web Development)

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This starts the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:9002`. Open this URL in your browser to work on the UI components.

## Building

### Building the Chrome Extension

1.  **Build the Next.js App for the Extension:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:ext
    ```
    This command runs `next build` followed by the `postbuild` script (`npm run postbuild`). The static files required for the Chrome extension will be placed in the `out` directory, along with the necessary manifest, background scripts, and icons copied from the `public` folder.

### Building for GitHub Pages (Static Web Deployment)

1.  **Build the Static Site:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:gh
    ```
    This command simply runs `next build` (which includes `next export` because of the configuration in `next.config.ts`). The static files will be placed in the `out` directory.

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
3.  Click on the **Load unpacked** button.
4.  Select the `out` directory generated by the `npm run build:ext` process.
5.  The EcoBrowse extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar. Click it to open the popup.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automatically build and deploy the static website to GitHub Pages when you push to your default branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).

1.  **Repository Setup:**
    *   Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
    *   Under **Build and deployment**, select **Source** as **GitHub Actions**.
2.  **Push Changes:** Push your code to the default branch. The workflow will run automatically.
3.  **Access Site:** Once the deployment is complete, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`. (If your repository is named `<your-username>.github.io`, it will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`).

**Manual Deployment (Alternative):**

If you prefer not to use GitHub Actions, you can deploy manually:

1.  Build the static site:
    ```bash
    npm run build:gh
    ```
2.  Deploy the contents of the `out` directory using the `gh-pages` tool:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy:gh
    ```
    This command pushes the `out` directory contents to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. Make sure your repository Pages settings are configured to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch if using this method.

## Project Structure

-   `src/app/`: Contains the main Next.js application pages and layout (used for the web app and extension popup).
-   `src/components/`: Reusable React components for the UI.
-   `src/services/`: Services like the carbon footprint calculator.
-   `public/`: Static assets, including the `manifest.json`, icons, and background/content scripts (used specifically for the extension build).
-   `out/`: (Generated after build) Contains the static files for the web app or Chrome extension.
-   `.github/workflows/`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.

## Core Features

-   **Footprint Calculation:** Estimates website carbon footprint based on heuristic modeling.
-   **Score Display:** Shows the eco-efficiency score visually (higher is better).
-   **Factor Details:** Provides insights into estimated data transfer, server efficiency, and renewable energy use.
-   **Statistical Reports:** Stores browsing consumption data locally and displays aggregated reports (Weekly, Monthly, Annual).
-   **PDF Downloads:** Allows downloading aggregated reports as PDF.
-   **Popular Sites:** Shows estimated eco-scores for common websites.
-   **Chrome Extension:** Can be packaged as a Chrome extension to analyze the current tab (though primary functionality is within the popup UI).
